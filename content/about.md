## EXPERIENCE

2019-Present: **Data Science Consultant**, [https://www.hasanai.com](https://www.hasanai.com/)

- Predicted the fraction of client&#39;s customer loan that would be delinquent by the end of the loan term, using polynomial regression with a mean squared error of 2.4e-8.
- Classified client&#39;s customer churn, using logistic regression in MLlib and PySpark.

 2019-Present: **Data Science Fellow** , SharpestMinds

- Product Sentiment Analysis Web App ([ly/twittsense](http://bit.ly/twittsense)): Implemented an NLP research paper into a Web App. The App collects live tweets about a product and determines an overall positive or negative sentiment expressed towards that product using the Twitter API, Convolution Neural Networks and LSTM.
- Recommender System: Made a movie recommender system, based on 20 million movie reviews, using collaborative filtering in PySpark.
- Spam Filter: Built an NLP pipeline to identify Spam text with 93% accuracy.

## PERSONAL PROJECTS

- Wrangling OpenStreetMap Data: Extracted, audited, cleaned and transformed data, about my city of Lexington-KY, in XML format to CSV and then queried the data using SQL and produced a visualization of interesting facts like most popular cuisine, amenities and shops.
- Identifying fraud using Enron data: Identified fraudulent employees at Enron using various machine learning techniques and algorithms with the final model yielding 89% accuracy and 65% precision despite having 45% data missing.
- Forensic Cluster Analysis: Identified number of hackers using K-means clustering on session meta data, in PySpark.
- Identifying chemical causing food spoilage: Using random forest classifier, identified chemical most likely to cause food spoilage.
